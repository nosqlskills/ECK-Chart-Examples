# If deploying multiple Kibana's these MUST be the same across all of them, or the task manager will treat them seperately.
# Not setting these can result in total failure when restoring data as they are based on auto-generated secrets by the operator. Better to set than to back up.
# This is for demonstration purposes. You should be setting these in a way that doesn't store secrets in plain text.
# These need to be converted to b64 in order to deploy. They are plain text to demonstrate that they are not safe.
